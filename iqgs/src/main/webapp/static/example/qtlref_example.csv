Aluminum tolerance associated with quantitative trait loci derived from soybean PI 416937 in hydroponics	Bianchi-Hall, C.M., Carter, T.E. Jr., Bailey, M.A., Mian, M.A.R., Rufty, T.W., Ashley, D.A., Boerma, H.R., Arellano, C., Hussey, R.S., Parrott, W.A.	Crop Sci. 2000, 40(2):538-545	Acid soils with high levels of Al impede root growth, causing increased crop sensitivity to drought and decreased nutrient acquisition. Development of Al-tolerant cultivars may be a cost effective response to the problem. In previous investigations, we identified an Al-tolerant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plant introduction from Japan (PI 416937), and subsequently determined the heritability of the trait in a cross with Young, a highly productive Al-sensitive cultivar. The objective of the present study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) which condition Al tolerance by a genetic linkage map of 155 restriction fragment Length polymorphism (RFLP) marker loci and a hydroponics-based Al response. The 120 F-4-derived progeny from Young X PI 416937 were divided into four sets and evaluated with the parents for tap root extension in 0 and 2 mu M Al3+ activity solutions (NOAL and DIAL, respectively) employing Al levels as whole plots in a split-plot experimental design. Aluminum tolerance was defined as (i) root extension under DIAL conditions, and (ii) root extension as a percentage of control [PC = (HIAL/NOAL) X 100]. Multiple regression analysis revealed five QTL from independent linkage groups which conditioned root extension under HIAL stress. Three of the five QTL were also detected by PC as the expression of Al tolerance. While most alleles for Al tolerance were derived from the AI-tolerant parent, PI 416937, a RFLP allele from Young (for marker EV2-1) improved Al tolerance expressed as PC and exhibited a similar trend under DIAL stress. At present, it is not known whether the Al tolerance gene from Young, in combination with those from PI 416937, will raise Al tolerance beyond that now observed in the PI. One allele for Al tolerance from PI 416937 (for marker B122-1) may be difficult to capitalize upon, agronomically, because of its association with a detrimental pod dehiscence factor. Further experimentation is needed to distinguish between linkage and pleiotropic effects near this marker. A favorable epistatic effect for Al tolerance was detected between two alleles from the PI 416937. The relationships revealed by marker analysis indicated that marker-facilitated selection may be a viable approach in the breeding of Al-tolerant soybean.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Aluminum+tolerance+associated+with+quantitative+trait+loci+derived+from+soybean+PI+416937+in+hydroponics	Al tolerance 1-1
The genetic control of tolerance t aluminum toxicity in the Essex by Forrest recombinant inbred line population	Sharma, A., Sharma, H., Lightfoot, D.	Theor. Appl. Genet. 2010, 122(4):687-694	Aluminum (Al) toxicity to plant roots is a major problem of acidic soils. The main chemical reaction involved is Al hydrolysis. Application of lime or nitrate fertilizers to raise soil pH reduces Al toxicity but not as economically as a plant genotypes with natural tolerance against this stress. Ammonium fertilization of crops and assimilation of ammonium (even that derived from dinitrogen) are particularly acidifying of the root zone. The aims of the present study were to find genotypes of soybean tolerant to aluminum stress and identify QTL underlying that trait. Used were recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of ?Essex by ?Forrest. RILs were grown in a greenhouse for 3 weeks and then transferred to hydroponics in a growth chamber. Root lengths (RL) were measured before and 72 h after Al treatment. RL before and after Al treatment were measured and used to calculate root tolerance index (RTI) and relative mean growth (RMG). RILs 1, 85, 40 and 83 had significant (P < 0.005) tolerance to Al stress judged by RL after Al, RTI and RMG. Eleven minor but significant marker?trait associations (P < 0.05) were detected using one-way ANOVA but only two major loci were significant in composite interval maps (LOD >3.0). The QTL on linkage group F (chromosome 13) was in the interval Satt160?Satt252 with a peak at 24 cM (peak LOD was 3.3). The QTL underlay 31% of trait variation and the Essex allele provided an additional 1.61 cm of root growth over 72 h in the presence of Al. The QTL on linkage group C2 (probably chromosome 4) was in the interval from Satt202 to Satt371 with a peak at 3.2 cM (peak LOD was 14.7). The QTL underlay 34% of trait variation or 1.81 cm of growth over 72 h in the presence of Al. Both loci encompassed genes implicated in citrate metabolism, a method of aluminum detoxification known to vary among soybean cultivars. Two major loci and at least nine minor loci were inferred to underlie tolerance to Al. RILs and markers may be used to select alleles that increase tolerance to soybean against Al stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+genetic+control+of+tolerance+t+aluminum+toxicity+in+the+Essex+by+Forrest+recombinant+inbred+line+population	Al tolerance 2-1
Molecular mapping of soybean rust resistance in soybean accession PI 561356 and SNP haplotype analysis o the Rpp1 region in diverse germplasm	Kim, K., Unfried, J., Hyten, D., Frederick, R., Hartman, G., Nelson, R., Song, Q., Diers, B.	Theor. Appl. Genet. 2012, 125(6):1339-1352	Soybean rust (SBR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow, is one of the most economically important and destructive diseases of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and the discovery of novel SBR resistance genes is needed because of virulence diversity in the pathogen. The objectives of this research were to map SBR resistance in plant introduction (PI) 561356 and to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes within the region on soybean chromosome 18 where the SBR resistance gene Rpp1 maps. One-hundred F2:3 lines derived from a cross between PI 561356 and the susceptible experimental line LD02-4485 were genotyped with genetic markers and phenotyped for resistance to P. pachyrhizi isolate ZM01-1. The segregation ratio of reddish brown versus tan lesion type in the population supported that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. The gene was mapped to a 1-cM region on soybean chromosome 18 corresponding to the same interval as Rpp1. A haplotype analysis of diverse germplasm across a 213-kb interval that included Rpp1 revealed 21 distinct haplotypes of which 4 were present among 5 SBR resistance sources that have a resistance gene in the Rpp1 region. Four major North American soybean ancestors belong to the same SNP haplotype as PI 561356 and seven belong to the same haplotype as PI 594538A, the Rpp1-b source. There were no North American soybean ancestors belonging to the SNP haplotypes found in PI 200492, the source of Rpp1, or PI 587886 and PI 587880A, additional sources with SBR resistance mapping to the Rpp1 region	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Molecular+mapping+of+soybean+rust+resistance+in+soybean+accession+PI+561356+and+SNP+haplotype+analysis+o+the+Rpp1+region+in+diverse+germplasm	Asian Soybean Rust 1-1
